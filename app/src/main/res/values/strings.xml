        <b>NotificationCompatBuilder</b>
        with a custom content view. The layout of the notification is defined as a
        layout resource and inflated as a <b>RemoteViews</b> object.

        the <i>big content view</i>, which is used when the notification is expanded.
        \n\n<b>Use the button below to create the notification.
        \n\nIf your device is running Jelly Bean or above, try expanding or collapsing
        the notification to see the different layouts.</b>
